# British Cafe Website

Welcome to the British Cafe website project! This project is designed for beginners to learn the basics of HTML by creating a simple multi-page website.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main page of the British Cafe website.
- `about.html`: A page that provides information about the British Cafe.
- `menu.html`: A page that displays the menu of the British Cafe.
- `scripts/main.js`: A JavaScript file for any future functionality.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## How to View the Site

1. Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the main page.
3. Navigate to the other pages (`about.html` and `menu.html`) using the links provided in the navigation menu.

## Additional Notes

- This project uses placeholder images from Lorem Picsum. You can replace these with actual images as needed.
- Feel free to modify the HTML files to practice and learn more about HTML tags and structure.
- The JavaScript file is currently empty, but you can add your own scripts to enhance the functionality of the website.

Happy coding!
